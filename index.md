Thi site gathers usage information of the [MPI](https://www.mpi-forum.org/) programming model in several MPI programs.
We use static analysis to gather information about MPI usage, including MPI calls usage, size of code, and usage of MPI with other programming models, such as OpenMP. 

A technical paper about this analysis was published at [SC19](https://sc19.supercomputing.org/). Please use the following citation when citing this survey:
